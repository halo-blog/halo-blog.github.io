# Generative macOS Big Sur Waves ðŸŒŠ [SVG]

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/georgedoescode/pen/bGBzGKZ](https://codepen.io/georgedoescode/pen/bGBzGKZ).

This is a generative program that creates macOS Big Sur style wave backgrounds. Each image is random within constraints 

The waves generated here may not always look perfect, but they are unique! If you find an output you like, you can copy the SVG to your clipboard using the download button ðŸš€

Interested in a tutorial on how I made this? Let me know!
